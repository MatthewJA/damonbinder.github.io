Here is a list of all the papers, essays and notes I've written.

## 2016
* **Non-Anomalous Semigroups and Real Numbers**. A paper presenting a novel definition of the real numbers. I wrote a [blog post](https://damonbinder.github.io/blog/real-numbers/) explaining the basic ideas. The paper can be found on the arxiv at <https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05997>.

* [**Dark Matter and the Diphoton Excess**](/documents/DiphotonResonance.pdf). Some notes I wrote in January on the 750 GeV diphoton resonance. The diphoton resonance now appears to have be a statistical fluctuation, so my notes now stand as a testament to this curious time in particle physics history.

## 2015
* I did a reading course on general relativity with Susan Scott. My final report can be found [here](/documents/GRReport.pdf). The most interesting parts are a discussion of the energy conditions in FRW cosmology, and a book review of *Quantum Field Theory: The Why, What and How* by Thanu Padmanabhan. The slides for my final presentation, on the singularity theorems, can be found [here](/documents/GRPresentation.pdf).

* I also did a reading course on quantum field theory with Vladimir Bazhanov. My final [report](/documents/WKBReport.pdf) was on higher order corrections to the WKB method, as was my [final presentation](/documents/WKBPresentation).



## 2014
* [get the PDF](/documents/SUSYQM.pdf)

## 2013
In high school I did the International Baccalaureate system, which requires students to write an extended essay on a topic of their choosing. Since I struggled to find good maths extended essays, I have uploaded mine [here](/documents/ExtendedEssay.pdf) in the hope it will prove useful to future students (and also to prove you don't *have* to do cryptography as your topic).
